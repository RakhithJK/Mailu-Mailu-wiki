WIP that can be finetuned at the next meeting. The Mailu project strayed away from its core goals. However we have not really documented what Mailu is. For who is Mailu? What is Mailu? What are our goals?

We have some goals on the front-page, but this is not specific enough yet. https://mailu.io/1.9/general.html

# Vision
Our vision is to provide a software solution for running your own mail server.

# Mission
Our mission is to provide a hasslefree OSS solution for deploying a mail stack without extensive knowledge of email software.

We will do this by providing a setup utility that will create the mail stack configuration only requiring some general questions as input. 
We aim to reduce the cost of ownership (required maintenance).
We will make sure the solution is secure by design without requiring extensive knowledge of current security best practices.

However, the system administrator needs at least basic knowledge in regard to networking (ip address, firewalls), how to configure DNS records and how to configure reverse DNS (ptr) records.

Mailu is an OSS project. Anyone can contribute to the project as long their contribution follows the core goals of Mailu. 

# Goals
In order to achieve our vision and mission, we have the following goals

- Only use free software.
- Provide a setup utility that guides the user in creating the Mailu software configuration.
- Design Mailu to be insular. Mailu does require external software to function.
- Keep the cost of ownership (required maintenance) low.
- Ensure Mailu is secure by design. 
- Provide an intuitive interface for configuring the Mailu software
- Provide sufficient documentation for going through all the steps for deploying a Mailu solution.
- Keep the amount of complexity to a minimum. Mailu is aimed on persons without extensive knowledge of email software.
- Mailu authors are all equal in regard to copyright, the license will remain free.
